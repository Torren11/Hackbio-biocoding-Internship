## Overview:
In this repository, I've completed the Stage-One task for the HackBio Biocoding Internship. The task required writing functions in R to solve biological problems. Below is a breakdown of the functions I’ve written in R:

1. **DNA to Protein Translation**  
   This function translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence using the standard genetic code. The input is a DNA string, and the output is the corresponding protein sequence.

2. **Simulating Logistic Population Growth**  
   This function simulates logistic growth of a population over time. It includes randomization of the lag phase and exponential phase to generate different population growth curves. The growth curve is then plotted as "Population Size vs Time."

3. **Calculating Time to 80% of Maximum Growth**  
   This function calculates the time it takes for a population to reach 80% of its carrying capacity (K) during logistic growth. It uses the logistic growth function from the second task.

4. **Calculating Hamming Distance**  
   This function calculates the Hamming distance between two strings (Slack username and Twitter handle). The Hamming distance measures the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.

## Files:
- `Sage_One_task_solution.R`: Contains the R code with all four functions.
- `README.md`: This file explaining the solution.

## How to Run:
To run the R functions:
1. Install R on your computer if it’s not already installed from [here](https://cran.r-project.org).
2. Open the R console or RStudio.
3. Copy the content of `Sage_One_task_solution.R` into your R script editor or R console.
4. Execute the code and run the functions as needed.
