# Hackbio Biocoding Internship - Stage Zero

## Overview:
This project is a simple solution that implements the information of 6 team members in an organized simple data structures in R 
## Team Members:
1. **Grace** - Biochemistry (R)
2. **Laura** - Microalgae Biotechnology and Ecology (Python)
3. **Temitope** - Biology (Python)
4. **Becca** - Biomedical Engineering (Python)
5. **Emma** - Plant Biology and Biotechnology (Python)
6. **Osas** - Animal Science (Pyhton)

## Code Structure
A data frame defines  lists of Team_tryosine  variables of the same number of rows with unique row names
The print() function displays the details for each team member at the console.


## Code Description:
1. Clone the repository,
2. Navigate to the 'Stage-Zero' folder,
3. Run the R script to view the details.
